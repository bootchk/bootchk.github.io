How
---

I followed [Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)

Why
---

My [old blog](https://plashless.wordpress.com/).   WordPress is too general purpose, with too much emphasis on style.  
I didn't get much social interaction.  I am not sure it was found by search engines.
Here, I hope to be closer to an interested audience.

What
---

Mainly a blog: little snippets of my experiences programming.

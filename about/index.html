I am maintainer for the GIMP plugin [Resynthesizer](https://github.com/bootchk/resynthesizer).  
So I am interested in:
  * image processing algorithms.
  * open source
  * distribution and packaging

I program and build embedded computers.  Many projects are artworks or products that I call "solabiles", solar powered mobiles.
So I am interested in:
  * solar power
  * embedded computers
  * ultra low power computers
  * Bluetooth and other radio chips
  * TI MSP430 mcu and Nordic NRF5280 ARM/radio chips
  
I program in C and Python, and I am studying Rust.
So I am also interested in:
   * programming languages
   * compilers
   * programming environments

  
My CV also indicates my interests.
